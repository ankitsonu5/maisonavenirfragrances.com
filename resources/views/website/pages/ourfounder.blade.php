                    <p class="strategy">While perfumery was my birthright, I took a detour to <strong>Unilever HQ in
                            London</strong>, where I was lucky enough to get my hands into one of their biggest brands,
                        <strong>AXE/Lynx</strong>.
                        There, I learned how to turn a product into a cultural phenomenon and help support a major brand
                        shift from 'spray to get the girl', to a leading men's-grooming brand.
                        Subsequent to that I was working with <strong>Tesco.com</strong>, in the foundation years of
                        eCommerce as a major revenue stream for Unilever.
                        We were in a unique position, with the power and resources of an organization like Unilever, but
                        flexibility to build and customize our business to capitalize on the eCommerce world.

                    <p class="strategy">But heritage has a way of calling you back. With the scent of home in my nose,
                        nine years ago, I moved back to Dubai, joined the family business, ready to bring a fresh
                        perspective and a vision for the future.</p>
